# Gallery App

I have made an Gallery Application to add image and show using card view.<br>
Download [APK](https://github.com/imAtulSharma/Gallery-App/releases/download/v1.0/app-debug.apk) for the application.

## Features in the application

- Make the activity in portrait mode only when dialog appears
- And make the orientation normal when dialog destroys

## Previews of the application
